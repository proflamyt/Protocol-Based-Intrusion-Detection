# Protocol-Based-Intrusion-Detection


An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and issues alerts when such activity is discovered.

Using Machine Learning to dectect Anomaly in the activity

HTTP/HTTPS Protocol-based Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning (HPIDML) is a system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect any abnormal or malicious activity on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

Step 1: Data Collection

The first step in implementing HPIDML is to collect data from the network. This data will be used to train the machine learning algorithms and to detect any anomalies in the network. The data can be collected using various tools such as Wireshark, Tcpdump, etc.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and to make it suitable for the machine learning algorithms. The preprocessing step includes cleaning the data, removing any missing values, and normalizing the data.

Step 3: Feature Extraction

The next step is to extract features from the preprocessed data that are relevant to the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. These features can include the URL, headers, request method, and response code.

Step 4: Model Training

Once the features are extracted, the next step is to train the machine learning algorithms. The algorithms that can be used include Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The algorithms are trained using the extracted features and the labeled data.

Step 5: Model Evaluation

After the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to check its accuracy. The evaluation step includes testing the model using a set of test data and comparing the results with the actual results.

Step 6: Deployment

Once the model is evaluated and found to be accurate, it can be deployed on the network. The deployed model will be used to detect any anomalies in the network traffic and to generate alerts for any malicious activity on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

The final step is to monitor the system and to perform regular maintenance. This includes updating the system with new data, retraining the model if necessary, and monitoring the system for any errors or bugs.

Overall, HPIDML is a powerful system that can detect any malicious activity on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols using machine learning algorithms. The system is implemented using Python and is based on a protocol-based approach, which makes it more accurate and efficient in detecting any anomalies in the network traffic.
